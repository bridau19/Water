        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Water conservation</span> includes policies and programs put in place to change peoples' behaviors in order to reduce water waste, use, or loss. This means using water only when needed, such as shower for less time and not wasting food! in many cases, water conservation has to do with reducing your direct water use.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Water efficiency</span> means doing more with less water by minimizing the amount of water used to accomplish a particular task. For example, low-flow toilets and showerheads are designed to use the least amount of water possible without compromizing convenience. Remember, having more efficient appliances is not an excuse to use them more and waste energy!</p>

      <!-- paragraph with info on ways to save water, font weight style attribute in span tag makes a section of the paragraph bold -->
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Change your diet:</span> It takes a huge amount of water to make animal products such as meat and dairy, so eating lower on the food chain can reduce your water footprint. Eating whole, nonprocessed foods is also a way to save water.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Shop smarter:</span> Buy reusable products, try to donate old or used items, recycle paper, glass, and bottles, and go thrift shopping! It takes a lot of water to make all of these products, so living sustainably will make your water use more efficient.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Get a dishwasher: </span>Washing dishes by hand can use 20 gallons of water, whereas a full load in a modern energy efficient dishwasher model uses 4.5 gallons!</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Utility efficiency: </span>Use low flow showerheads, faucets, and toilets. Also get a water efficient washing machine and only wash full loads. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Energy: </span>Conserve electricity and gas by using renewable energy, driving less, and using LED lights. Making energy takes water!</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Outside:</span> Install a greywater system or use a rain barrel for waering your plants. Plant native species that do not require a lot of extra watering. Water your lawn on cool, windy days to prevent evaporation loss. Use moisture detectors with automatic sprinklers or install a drip irrigation system instead!</p>
